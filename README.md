# Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard
A comprehensive Bank Loan Report Dashboard, designed to significantly enhance our oversight and evaluation of the bank's loan operations. This innovative dashboard graphically presents vital loan metrics and trends through a variety of chart types, including line charts for monthly trends, filled maps for regional analysis, donut charts for loan term distribution, bar charts for employment length impact, and tree maps for loan purpose breakdown and home ownership analysis. 
Aimed at facilitating informed decision-making, the dashboard tracks our loan portfolio's status and identifies lending strategy trends. The 'Details Dashboard' section further consolidates all crucial loan data into a user-friendly interface, offering a complete view of loan metrics, borrower profiles, and loan performance. 
This tool is tailored to support strategic decisions, providing deep insights into our loan operations.
